Second-Order Kernel Online Convex Optimization with Adaptive Sketching

Abstract

Kernel online convex optimization (KOCO) is a
framework combining the expressiveness of non-
parametric kernel models with the regret guaran-
tees of online learning. First-order KOCO meth-
ods such as functional gradient descent require
only O(t) time and space per iteration, and, when
√
the only information on the losses is their con-
vexity, achieve a minimax optimal O(
T ) re-
gret. Nonetheless, many common losses in ker-
nel problems, such as squared loss, logistic loss,
and squared hinge loss posses stronger curvature
that can be exploited. In this case, second-order
KOCO methods achieve O(log(Det(K))) regret,
which we show scales as O(deff log T ), where
deff is the effective dimension of the problem and
is usually much smaller than O(
T ). The main
drawback of second-order methods is their much
higher O(t2) space and time complexity. In this
paper, we introduce kernel online Newton step
(KONS), a new second-order KOCO method that
also achieves O(deff log T ) regret. To address the
computational complexity of second-order meth-
ods, we introduce a new matrix sketching algo-
rithm for the kernel matrix Kt, and show that for
a chosen parameter γ ≤ 1 our Sketched-KONS
reduces the space and time complexity by a fac-
tor of γ2 to O(t2γ2) space and time per iteration,
while incurring only 1/γ times more regret.

1. Introduction
Online convex optimization (OCO) (Zinkevich, 2003) mod-
els the problem of convex optimization over Rd as a game
over t ∈ {1, . . . , T} time steps between an adversary and
the player. In its linear version, that we refer to as linear-
OCO (LOCO), the adversary chooses a sequence of arbi-
trary convex losses (cid:96)t and points xt, and a player chooses
weights wt and predicts xT
t wt. The goal of the player is to

minimize the regret, deﬁned as the difference between the
losses of the predictions obtained using the weights played
by the player and the best ﬁxed weight in hindsight given
all points and losses.
Gradient descent. For this setting, Zinkevich (2003)
showed that simple gradient descent (GD), combined with
√
a smart choice for the stepsize ηt of the gradient updates,
dT ) regret with a O(d) space and time
achieves a O(
cost per iteration. When the only assumption on the losses
is simple convexity, this upper bound matches the cor-
responding lower bound (Luo et al., 2016), thus making
ﬁrst-order methods (e.g., GD) essentially unimprovable in
a minimax sense. Nonetheless, when the losses have addi-
tional curvature properties, Hazan et al. (2006) show that
online Newton step (ONS), an adaptive method that ex-
ploits second-order (second derivative) information on the
losses, can achieve a logarithmic regret O(d log T ). The
downside of this adaptive method is the larger O(d2) space
and per-step time complexity, since second-order updates
require to construct, store, and invert Ht, a preconditioner
matrix related to the Hessian of the losses used to correct
the ﬁrst-order updates.
Kernel gradient descent. For linear models, such as the
ones considered in LOCO, a simple way to create more ex-
pressive models is to map them in some high-dimensional
space, the feature space, and then use the kernel trick
(Sch¨olkopf & Smola, 2001) to avoid explicitly comput-
ing their high-dimensional representation. Mapping to a
larger space allows the algorithm to better ﬁt the losses
chosen by the adversary and reduce its cumulative loss.
As a drawback, the Kernel OCO (KOCO) problem1 is
fundamentally harder than LOCO, due to 1) the fact that
an inﬁnite parametrization makes regret bounds scaling
with the dimension d meaningless and 2) the size of the
model, and therefore time and space complexities, scales
with t itself, making these methods even less performant
than LOCO algorithms. Kernel extensions of LOCO algo-
rithms have been proposed for KOCO, such as functional
GD (e.g., NORMA, Kivinen et al., 2004) which achieves
a O(
T ) regret with a O(t) space and time cost per iter-
ation. For second-order methods, the Second-Order Per-

ceptron (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2005) or NAROW (Orabona
& Crammer, 2010) for generic curved losses and Recur-
sive Kernel Least Squares (Zhdanov & Kalnishkan, 2010)
or Kernel AAR (Gammerman et al., 2004) for the speciﬁc
case of (cid:96)2 losses provide bounds that scale with the log-
determinant of the kernel-matrix. As we show, this quan-
tity is closely related to the effective dimension dT
eff of the
of the points xt, and scales as O(dT
eff log T ), playing a sim-
ilar role as the O(d log T ) bound from LOCO.
Approximate GD. To trade off between computational
(close to O(d log T )), several methods try approximate
second-order updates,
replacing Ht with an approxi-

complexity (cid:0)smaller than O(d2)(cid:1) and improved regret
mate (cid:101)Ht that can be efﬁciently stored and inverted. Ada-
ing a diagonal (cid:101)Ht, but these methods ultimately only im-
sketch (cid:101)Ht, that can be efﬁciently stored and updated in

prove the regret dependency on d and leave the
ponent unchanged. Sketched-ONS, by Luo et al. (2016),
uses matrix sketching to approximate Ht with a r-rank
O(dr2) time and space, close to the O(d) complexity of di-
agonal approximations. More importantly, Sketched-ONS
achieves a much smaller regret compared to diagonal ap-
proximations: When the true Ht is of low-rank r, it recov-
ers a O(r log T ) regret bound logarithmic in T . Unfortu-
nately, due to the sketch approximation, a new term appears
in the bound that scales with the spectra of Ht, and in some
cases can grow much larger than O(log T ).
Approximate kernel GD. Existing approximate GD meth-
ods for KOCO focus only on ﬁrst-order updates, trying to
reduce the O(t) per-step complexity. Budgeted methods,
such as Budgeted-GD (Wang et al., 2012) and budgeted
variants of the perceptron (Cavallanti et al., 2007; Dekel
et al., 2008; Orabona et al., 2008) explicitly limit the size
of the model, using some destructive budget maintenance
procedure (e.g., removal, projection) to constrain the nat-
ural model growth over time. Alternatively, functional ap-
proximation methods in the primal (Lu et al., 2016) or dual
(Le et al., 2016) use non-linear embedding techniques, such
as random feature expansion (Le et al., 2013), to reduce
√
the KOCO problem to a LOCO problem and solve it ef-
ﬁciently. Unfortunately, to guarantee O(
T ) regret us-
ing less than O(t) space and time per round w.h.p., all
of these methods require additional assumptions, such as
points xt coming from a distribution or strong convexity
√
on the losses. Moreover, as approximate ﬁrst-order meth-
ods, they can at most hope to match the O(
T ) regret of
exact GD, and among second-order kernel methods, no ap-
proximation scheme has been proposed that can provably
maintain the same O(log T ) regret as exact GD. In addi-
tion, approximating Ht is harder for KOCO, since we can-
not directly access the matrix representation of Ht in the

feature-space, making diagonal approximation impossible,
and low-rank sketching harder.
Contributions In this paper, we introduce Kernel-ONS, an
extension to KOCO of the ONS algorithm. As a second-
order method, KONS achieves a O(dt
eff log T ) regret on
a variety of curved losses, and runs in O(t2) time and
space. To alleviate the computational complexity, we pro-
pose SKETCHED-KONS, the ﬁrst approximate second-
order KOCO methods, that approximates the kernel matrix
with a low-rank sketch. To compute this sketch we pro-
pose a new online kernel dictionary learning, kernel online
row sampling, based on ridge leverage scores. By adap-
tively increasing the size of its sketch, SKETCHED-KONS
provides a favorable regret-performance trade-off, where
for a given factor γ ≤ 1, we can increase the regret by
a linear 1/γ factor to O(dt
eff log(T )/γ) while obtaining a
quadratic γ2 improvement in runtime, thereby achieving
O(t2γ2) space and time cost per iteration.

2. Background
In this section, we introduce linear algebra and RKHS
notation, and formally state the OCO problem in an
RKHS (Sch¨olkopf & Smola, 2001).
Notation. We use upper-case bold letters A for matrices,
lower-case bold letters a for vectors, lower-case letters a
for scalars. We denote by [A]ij and [a]i the (i, j) element
of a matrix and i-th element of a vector respectively. We
denote by IT ∈ RT×T , the identity matrix of dimension T
and by Diag(a) ∈ RT×T , the diagonal matrix with the vec-
tor a ∈ RT on the diagonal. We use eT,i ∈ RT to denote
the indicator vector of dimension T for element i. When
the dimension of I and ei is clear from the context, we omit
the T . We also indicate with I the identity operator. We use
A (cid:23) B to indicate that A − B is a positive semi-deﬁnite
(PSD) matrix. With (cid:107)·(cid:107) we indicate the operator (cid:96)2-norm.
Finally, the set of integers between 1 and T is denoted by
[T ] := {1, . . . , T}.
Kernels. Given an arbitrary input space X and a positive
deﬁnite kernel function K : X×X → R, we indicate the re-
producing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) associated with K
as H. We choose to represent our Hilbert space H as a fea-
ture space where, given K, we can ﬁnd an associated fea-
ture map ϕ : X → H, such that K(x, x(cid:48)) can be expressed
as an inner product K(x, x(cid:48)) = (cid:104)ϕ(x), ϕ(x(cid:48))(cid:105)H. With a
slight abuse of notation, we represent our feature space
as an high-dimensional vector space, or in other words
H ⊆ RD, where D is very large or potentially inﬁnite.
With this notation, we can write the inner product simply as
K(x, x(cid:48)) = ϕ(x)Tϕ(x(cid:48)), and for any function fw ∈ H, we
can represent it as a (potentially inﬁnite) set of weights w
such that fw(x) = ϕ(x)Tw. Given points {xi}t

rest of the paper we consider the problem of kernelized
OCO (KOCO) where H is arbitrary and potentially non-
parametric. We refer to the special parametric case H =
Rd and φt = xt as linear OCO (LOCO).
In OCO, the goal is to design an algorithm that returns a so-
lution that performs almost as well as the best-in-class, thus
we must ﬁrst deﬁne our comparison class. We deﬁne the
feasible set as St = {w : |φT
t=1St.
This comparison class contains all functions fw whose out-
put is contained (clipped) in the interval [−C, C] on all
points x1, . . . , xT . Unlike the often used constraint on
(cid:107)w(cid:107)H (Hazan et al., 2006; Zhu & Xu, 2015), comparing
against clipped functions (Luo et al., 2016; Gammerman
et al., 2004; Zhdanov & Kalnishkan, 2010) has a clear inter-
pretation even when passing from Rd to H. Moreover, S is
invariant to linear transformations of H and suitable for
practical problems where it is often easier to choose a rea-

sonable interval for the predictions(cid:98)yt rather than a bound

on the norm of a (possibly non-interpretable) parametriza-

in S. We work with the following assumptions on the
losses.

Assumption 1. The loss function (cid:96)t satisﬁes |(cid:96)(cid:48)
whenever y ≤ C.
Note that this is equivalent to assuming Lipschitzness of the
the loss w.r.t. y and it is weaker than assuming something
on the norm of the gradient (cid:107)gt(cid:107), since (cid:107)gt(cid:107) = | ˙gt|(cid:107)φt(cid:107).
Assumption 2. There exists σt ≥ 0 such that for all

This condition is weaker than strong convexity and it is sat-
isﬁed by all exp-concave losses (Hazan et al., 2006). For
example, the squared loss lt(w) = (yt − xT
t w)2 is not
strongly convex but satisﬁes Asm. 2 with σt = 1/(8C 2)
when w ∈ S.

3. Kernelized Online Newton Step

by Hazan et al. (2006), is a projected gradient descent that
uses the following update rules

FTAL replaces the loss lt with a convex approximation us-
ing Asm. 2, and plays the minimizer of the surrogate func-
tion. As a result, under Asm. 1-2 and when σt ≥ σ > 0,
FTAL achieves a logarithmic O(d log T ) regret. FTAL’s
solution path can be computed in O(d2) time using ONS
updates, and further speedups were proposed by Luo et al.
(2016) using matrix sketching.
Unfortunately, in KOCO, vectors φt and weights wt can-
not be explicitly represented, and most of the quantities
used in vanilla ONS (Eq. 1) cannot be directly computed.
Instead, we derive a closed form alternative (Alg. 1) that
can be computed in practice. Using a rescaled variant

As a consequence, if we can ﬁnd a way to compute yt, then

Then, ut is equal to the same quantity in Eq. 1 and the se-

While the deﬁnition of bt and ut still requires perform-
ing operations in the (possibly inﬁnitely dimensional) fea-
ture space, in the following we show that bt and the pre-
diction yt can be conveniently computed using only inner
products.

Since Alg. 1 is equivalent to ONS (Eq. 1), existing regret
bounds for ONS directly applies to its kernelized version.
Proposition 1 (Luo et al., 2016). For any sequence of

fortunately, these quantities hold little meaning for KOCO
with D-dimensional features, since a O(

very large or even inﬁnite. On the other hand, we expect
the regret of KONS to depend on quantities that are more
strictly related to the kernel Kt and its complexity.

In general, leverage scores have been used to measure
the correlation between a point i w.r.t. the other t − 1
points, and therefore how essential it is in characteriz-
ing the dataset (Alaoui & Mahoney, 2015). As an ex-
ample, if φi is completely orthogonal to the other points,

RLS is minimal. While the previous deﬁnition is provided
for a generic kernel function K, we can easily instantiate it
on K and obtain the deﬁnition of τ t,i. By recalling the ﬁrst

4. Kernel Online Row Sampling
Although KONS achieves a low regret, storing and invert-
ing the K matrix requires O(t2) space and O(t3) time,
which becomes quickly unfeasible as t grows. To improve
space and time efﬁciency, we replace Kt with an accurate
chosen dictionary It of points from Dt. We extend the on-
line row sampling (ORS) algorithm of Cohen et al. (2016)
to the kernel setting and obtain Kernel-ORS (Alg. 2). There
are two main obstacles to overcome in the adaptation of
ORS: From an algorithmic perspective we need to ﬁnd a
computable estimator for the RLS, since φt cannot be ac-
cessed directly, while from an analysis perspective we must
prove that our space and time complexity does not scale
with the dimension of φt (as Cohen et al. 2016), as it can
potentially be inﬁnite.
We deﬁne a dictionary It as a collection of (index, weight)

tuples (i, 1/(cid:101)pi) and the associated selection matrix St ∈

which reveals a deep connection between the regret of
KONS and the cumulative sum of the RLS. In other words,
the RLS capture how much the adversary can increase
the regret by picking orthogonal directions that have not
been seen before. While in LOCO, this can happen at
most d times (hence the dependency on d in the ﬁnal regret,
which is mitigated by a suitable choice of ηt), in KOCO,
RG can grow linearly with time, since large H can have
inﬁnite near-orthogonal directions. Nonetheless, the actual
growth rate is now directly related to the complexity of the
sequence of points chosen by the adversary and the kernel
function K. While the effective dimension dt

We ﬁrst notice that in the ﬁrst inequality we relate d
onl(α)
to the log-determinant of the kernel matrix KT . This quan-
tity appears in a large number of works on online linear
prediction (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2005; Srinivas et al., 2010)
where they were connected to the maximal mutual infor-
mation gain in Gaussian processes. Finally, the second
inequality shows that in general the complexity of online
learning is only a factor log T (in the worst case) away
from the complexity of batch learning. At this point, we
can generalize the regret bounds of LOCO to KOCO.

6. Discussion
Regret guarantees. From Eq. 5 we can see that when τ min
is not too small, setting γ = 0 we recover the guarantees of
exact KONS. Since usually we do not know τ min, we can
choose to set γ > 0, and as long as γ ≥ 1/ polylog T , we
preserve a (poly)-logarithmic regret.
Computational speedup. The time required to compute
[t−1],tDt−1bt−1 gives a minimum O(t)
k[t−1],t, kt,t, and kT
per-step complexity. Note that Kt−1bt−1 can also be com-
dictionary at time t as Bt = (cid:101)O(deff(α)t + tγ), computing
puted incrementally in O(t) time. Denoting the size of the

and O(t2γ2) time to update the inverse and compute [bt]t.
Therefore, in the case when τ min is not too small, our run-
time is of the order O(dt
eff(α)2 + t), which is almost as
small as the O(t) runtime of GD but with the advantage
of a second-order method logarithmic regret. Moreover,
when τ min is small and we set a large γ, we can trade off a
1/γ increase in regret for a γ2 decrease in space and time
complexity when compared to exact KONS (e.g., setting
γ = 1/10 would correspond to a tenfold increase in regret,
but a hundred-fold reduction in computational complexity).

Asymptotic behavior. Notice however, that space and time
complexity, grow roughly with a term Ω(t mint
Ω(t max{γ, βτ min}), so if this quantity does not decrease
over time, the computational cost of SKETCHED-KONS
will remain large and close to exact KONS. This is to be
expected, since SKETCHED-KONS must always keep an
accurate sketch in order to guarantee a logarithmic regret
bound. Note that Luo et al. (2016) took an opposite ap-
proach for LOCO, where they keep a ﬁxed-size sketch but
possibly pay in regret, if this ﬁxed size happens to be too
small. Since a non-logarithmic regret is achievable simply
running vanilla GD, we rather opted for an adaptive sketch
at the cost of space and time complexity.
In batch opti-
mization, where (cid:96)t does not change over time, another pos-
sibility is to stop updating the solution once τ min becomes
too small. When Hs is the Hessian of (cid:96) in ws, then the
quantity gT
t gt, in the context of Newton’s method, is
called Newton decrement and it corresponds up to constant
factors to τ min. Since a stopping condition based on New-
ton’s decrement is directly related to the near-optimality of
the current wt (Nesterov & Nemirovskii, 1994), stopping
when τ min is small also provides guarantees about the qual-
ity of the solution.
Sampling distribution. Note that although γ > 0 means
that all columns have a small uniform chance of being se-

lected for inclusion in (cid:101)At, this is not equivalent to uni-

formly sampling columns. It is rather a combination of a
RLS-based sampling to ensure that columns important to
reconstruct At are selected and a threshold on the proba-
bilities to avoid too much variance in the estimator.
Biased estimator and results in expectation. The ran-
t ] =
t . Another option would be
t =
s used in KORS and a common choice
in matrix approximation methods, see e.g., Alaoui & Ma-
honey, 2015. Due to its unbiasedness, this variant would
automatically achieve the same logarithmic regret as ex-
act KONS in expectation (similar to the result obtained
by Luo et al., 2016, using Gaussian random projection in
LOCO). While any unbiased estimator, e.g., uniform sam-
pling of gt, would achieve this result, RLS-based sampling
already provides strong reconstruction guarantees sufﬁ-

cient to bound RG. Nonetheless, the weights 1/(cid:101)ps may
cause large variations in (cid:101)At over consecutive steps, thus

leading to a large regret RD in high probability.
Limitations of dictionary learning approaches and open
problems. From the discussion above, it appears that
a weighted, unbiased dictionary may not achieve high-
probability logarithmic guarantee because of the high vari-
ance coming from sampling. On the other hand, if we want
to recover the regret guarantee, we may have to pay for it

with a large dictionary. This may actually be due to the
analysis, the algorithm, or the setting. An important prop-
erty of the dictionary learning approach used in KORS is
that it can only add but not remove columns and potentially
re-weight them. Notice that in the batch setting (Alaoui &
Mahoney, 2015; Calandriello et al., 2017), the sampling of
columns does not cause any issue and we can have strong
learning guarantees in high probability with a small dictio-
nary. Alternative sketching methods such as Frequent Di-
rections (FD, Ghashami et al., 2016a) do create new atoms
as learning progresses. By restricting to composing dic-
tionaries from existing columns, we only have the degree
of freedom of the weights of the columns. If we set the
weights to have an unbiased estimate, we achieve an accu-
rate RG but suffer a huge regret in RD. On the other hand,
we can store the columns unweighted to have small RD but
large RG. This could be potentially ﬁxed if we knew how
to remove less important columns from dictionary to gain
some slack in RD.
We illustrate this problem with following simple scenario.
The adversary always presents to the learner the same
point x (with associated φ), but for the loss it alternates
between (cid:96)2t(wt) = (C − φTwt)2 on even steps and
(cid:96)2t+1(wt) = (−C − φTwt)2 on odd steps. Then, σt =
σ = 1/(8C 2), and we have a gradient that always points in
the same φ direction, but switches sign at each step. The
optimal solution in hindsight is asymptotically w = 0 and
let this be also our starting point w0. We also set ηt = σ,
since this is what ONS would do, and α = 1 for simplicity.
For this scenario, we can compute several useful quantities
in closed form, in particular, RG and RD,

Note that although the matrix At is rank 1 at each time step,
vanilla ONS does not take advantage of this easy data, and
would store it all with a O(t2) space in KOCO.
As for the sketched versions of ONS, sketching using
FD (Luo et al., 2016) would adapt to this situation, and
only store a single copy of gt = g, achieving the de-
sired regret with a much smaller space. Notice that in
this example, the losses (cid:96)t are effectively strongly convex,
and even basic gradient descent with a stepsize ηt = 1/t
would achieve logarithmic regret (Zhu & Xu, 2015) with
even smaller space. On the other hand, we show how the
dictionary-based sketching has difﬁculties in minimizing
the regret bound from Prop. 1 in our simple scenario. In
particular, consider an arbitrary (possibly randomized) al-
gorithm that is allowed only to reweight atoms in the dic-
tionary and not to create new ones (as FD). In our exam-
ple, this translates to choosing a schedule of weights ws

and set (cid:101)At = (cid:80)t
W = WT =(cid:80)T

s=1 wsφsφs = Wtφφ with total weight
s=1 ws and space complexity equal to the
number of non-zero weights B = |{ws (cid:54)= 0}|. We can
show that there is no schedule for this speciﬁc class of al-
gorithms with good performance due to the following three
conﬂicting goals.

(1) To mantain RG small,(cid:80)t

s=1 ws should be as large as

possible, as early as possible.

(2) To mantain RD small, we should choose weights
wt > 1 as few times as possible, since we accumu-
late max{wt − 1, 0} regret every time.

(3) To mantain the space complexity small, we should

choose only a few wt (cid:54)= 0.

imize RG we should raise the sum(cid:80)t

To enforce goal (3), we must choose a schedule with no
more than B non-zero entries. Given the budget B, to sat-
isfy goal (2) we should use all the B budget in order to
exploit as much as possible the max{wt − 1, 0} in RD, or
in other words we should use exactly B non-zero weights,
and none of these should be smaller than 1. Finally, to min-
s=1 ws as quickly as
possible, settling on a schedule where w1 = W − B and
ws = 1 for all the other B weights. It easy to see that if we
want logarithmic RG, W needs to grow as T , but doing so
with a logarithmic B would make RD = T − B = Ω(T ).
Similarly, keeping W = B in order to reduce RD would
increase RG. In particular notice, that the issue does not
go away even if we know the RLS perfectly, because the
same reasoning applies. This simple example suggests that
dictionary-based sketching methods, which are very suc-
cessful in batch scenarios, may actually fail in achieving
logarithmic regret in online optimization.
This argument raises the question on how to design alterna-
tive sketching methods for the second-order KOCO. A ﬁrst
approach, discussed above, is to reduce the dictionary size
dropping columns that become less important later in the
process, without allowing the adversary to take advantage
of this forgetting factor. Another possibility is to deviate
from the ONS approach and RD + RG regret decompo-
sition. Finally, as our counterexample in the simple sce-
nario hints, creating new atoms (either through projection
or merging) allows for better adaptivity, as shown by FD
(Ghashami et al., 2016a) based methods in LOCO. How-
ever, the kernelization of FD does not appear to be straigh-
forward. The most recent step in this direction (in particu-
lar, for kernel PCA) is only able to deal with ﬁnite feature
expansions (Ghashami et al., 2016b) and therefore its ap-
plication to kernels is limited.
