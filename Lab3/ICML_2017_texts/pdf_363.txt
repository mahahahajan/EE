Automatic Discovery of the Statistical Types of Variables in a Dataset

Isabel Valera 1 Zoubin Ghahramani 1 2

Abstract

A common practice in statistics and machine
learning is to assume that the statistical data types
(e.g., ordinal, categorical or real-valued) of vari-
ables, and usually also the likelihood model, is
known. However, as the availability of real-
world data increases, this assumption becomes
too restrictive. Data are often heterogeneous,
complex, and improperly or incompletely doc-
umented. Surprisingly, despite their practical
importance, there is still a lack of tools to au-
tomatically discover the statistical types of, as
well as appropriate likelihood (noise) models for,
the variables in a dataset. In this paper, we ﬁll
this gap by proposing a Bayesian method, which
accurately discovers the statistical data types in
both synthetic and real data.

1. Introduction
Data analysis problems often involve pre-processing raw
data, which is a tedious and time-demanding task due to
several reasons: i) raw data is often unstructured and large-
scale; ii) it contains errors and missing values; and iii)
documentation may be incomplete or not available. As a
consequence, as the availability of data increases, so does
the interest of the data science community to automate this
process. In particular, there are a growing body of work
which focuses on automating the different stages of data
pre-processing, including data cleaning (Hellerstein, 2008),
data wrangling (Kandel et al., 2011) and data integration
and fusion (Dong & Srivastava, 2013).
The outcome of data pre-processing is commonly a struc-
tured dataset, in which the objects are described by a set of
attributes. However, before being able to proceed with the
predictive analytics step of the data analysis process, the
data scientist often needs to identify which kind of vari-
ables (i.e., real-values, categorical, ordinal, etc.) these at-
tributes represent. This labeling of the data is necessary
to select the appropriate machine learning approach to ex-

plore, ﬁnd patterns or make predictions on the data. As an
example, a prediction task is solved differently depending
on the kind of data to be predicted—e.g., while prediction
on categorical variables is usually formulated as a classiﬁ-
cation task, in the case of ordinal variables it is formulated
as an ordinal regression problem (Agresti, 2010). More-
over, different data types should be pre-processed and input
differently in the predictive tool—e.g., categorical inputs
are often transformed into as many binary inputs (which
state whether the object belongs to a category or not) as
number of categories; positive real inputs might be log-
transformed, etc.
Information on the statistical data types in a dataset be-
comes particularly important in the context of statistical
machine learning (Breiman, 2001), where the choice of a
likelihood model appears as a main assumption. Although
extensive work has focused on model selection (Ando,
2010; Burnham & Anderson, 2003), the likelihood model
is usually assumed to be known and ﬁxed. As an example,
a common approach is to model continuous data as Gaus-
sian variables, and discrete data as categorical variables.
However, while extensive work has shown the advantages
of capturing the statistical properties of the observed data in
the likelihood model (Chu & Ghahramani, 2005a; Schmidt
et al., 2009; Hilbe, 2011; Valera & Ghahramani, 2014),
there still exists a lack of tools to automatically perform
likelihood model selection, or equivalently to discover the
most plausible statistical type of the variables in the data,
directly from the data.
In this work, we aim to ﬁll this gap by proposing a gen-
eral and scalable Bayesian method to solve this task. The
proposed method exploits the latent structure in the data to
automatically distinguish among real-valued, positive real-
valued and interval data as types of continuous variables,
and among categorical, ordinal and count data as types of
discrete variables. The proposed method is based on prob-
abilistic modeling and exploits the following key ideas:

i) There exists a latent structure in the data that capture
the statistical dependencies among the different ob-
jects and attributes in the dataset. Here, as in standard
latent feature modeling, we assume that we can cap-
ture this structure by a low-rank representation, such
that conditioning on it, the likelihood model factorizes
for both number of objects and attributes.

ii) The observation model for each attribute can be ex-

pressed as a mixture of likelihood models, one per
each considered data type, where the inferred weight
associated to a likelihood model captures the proba-
bility of the attribute belonging to the corresponding
data type.

We derive an efﬁcient MCMC inference algorithm to
jointly infer both the low-rank representation and the
weight of each likelihood model for each attribute in the
observed data. Our experimental results show that the pro-
posed method accurately discovers the true data type of the
variables in a dataset, and by doing so, it ﬁts the data sub-
stantially better than modeling continuous data as Gaussian
variables and discrete data as categorical variables.
2. Problem Statement
As stated above, the outcome of the pre-processing step
of data analysis is a structured dataset, in which a set of
objects are deﬁned by a set of attributes, and our objec-
tive is to automatically discover which type of variables
these attributes correspond to. In order to distinguish be-
tween discrete and continuous variables, we can apply sim-
ple logic rules, e.g.. count the number of unique values that
the attribute takes and how many times we observe these at-
tributes. Moreover, binary variables are invariant to the la-
beling of the categories, and therefore, both categorical and
ordinal models are equivalent in this case. However, distin-
guishing among different types of discrete and continuous
variables cannot be easily solved using simple heuristics.
In the context of continuous variables, given the ﬁnite size
of observed datasets, it is complicated to identify whether
a variable may take values in the entire real line, or only on
an interval of it, e.g., (0,∞) or (θL, θH ). In other words,
due to the ﬁnite observation sample, we cannot distinguish
whether the data distribution has an inﬁnite tail that we
have not observed, or its support is limited to an interval.
As an illustrative example, Figures 2(d)&(f) in Section 4
show two data distributions that, although at a ﬁrst sight
look similar, correspond respectively to a Beta variable,
which therefore takes values in the interval (0, 1), and a
gamma variable, which takes values in (0,∞).
In the context of discrete data, it is impossible to tell the dif-
ference between categorical and ordinal variables in isola-
tion. The presence of an order in the data only makes sense
given a context. As an example, while colors in M&Ms
usually do not present an order, colors in a trafﬁc light
clearly do. Similarly, we cannot easily distinguish between
ordinal data (which take values in a ﬁnite ordered set) and
count data (which take values in an inﬁnite ordered set with
equidistant values) due to two main reasons. First, similarly
to continuous variables, since datasets contain a ﬁnite num-
ber of examples, it is difﬁcult to tell whether we have ob-
served the ﬁnite set of possible values of a variable, or sim-
ply a ﬁnite subsample of an inﬁnite set. Second, we would

need access to exact information on whether its consecu-
tive values are equidistant or not, however, this information
depends on how the data have been gathered. For exam-
ple, an attribute that collects information on “frequency of
an action” will correspond to an ordinal variable if its cat-
egories belong to, e.g., {“never”, “sometimes”, “usually”,
“often”}, and to a count variable if it takes values in {‘‘0
times per week”, “1 time per week”, . . .}.
Previous work (Hernandez-Lobato et al., 2014) proposed to
distinguish between categorical and ordinal data by com-
paring the model evidence and the predictive test log-
likelihood of ordinal and categorical models. However, this
approach can be only used to distinguish between ordinal
and categorical data, and it does so by assuming that it has
access to a real-valued variable that contains information
about the presence of an ordering in the observed discrete
(ordinal or categorical) variable. As a consequence, it can-
not be easily generalizable to label the data type of all the
variables (or attributes) in a dataset. In contrast, in this pa-
per we proposed a general method that allows us to distin-
guish among real-valued, positive real-valued and interval
data as types of continuous variables, and among categor-
ical, ordinal and count data as types of discrete variables.
Moreover, the general framework we present can be readily
extended to other data types as needed.
3. Methodology
In this section, we introduce a Bayesian method to deter-
mine the statistical type of variable that corresponds to each
of the attributes describing the objects in an observation
matrix X. In particular, we propose a probabilistic model,
in which we assume that there exists a low-rank representa-
tion of the data that captures its latent structure, and there-
fore, the statistical dependencies among its objects and at-

K] (with K being the
weighting vector bd = [bd
number of latent variables), whose elements bd
k weight the
contribution of k-th the latent feature to the d-th attribute
in X. Then, given the latent low-rank representation of the
data, the attributes describing the objects in a dataset are
assumed to be independent, i.e.,

p(xd|Z, bd),

where we gather the latent feature vectors zn in a N × K
matrix Z. For convenience, here zn is a K-length row vec-
tor, while bd is a K-length column vector. The above model
resembles standard latent feature models (Salakhutdinov &
Mnih, 2007; Grifﬁths & Ghahramani, 2011), which assume
known and ﬁxed likelihood models p(xd|Z, bd). In con-
trast, in this paper we aim to infer the statistical data type

(or equivalently, the likelihood model) that better captures
the distribution of each attribute in X. To this end, here we
assume that the likelihood model of the d-th attribute in X
is a mixture of likelihood functions such that

p(xd|Z,{bd

(cid:96)}(cid:96)∈Ld ) =

where Ld is the set of possible types of variables (or equiv-
alently, likelihood models) to be considered for this at-
tribute, and the weight wd
(cid:96) captures the probability of the
likelihood function (cid:96) in the d-th attribute of the observa-
tion matrix X. Note that, the above expression is a valid

uous and discrete variables. Hence, under the proposed
model, which is is illustrated in Figure 1a, the likelihood
factorizes as

We place a Dirichlet prior distribution on the likelihood
weights wd = [wd

with zero mean and covariance matrices σ2

to the number of latent features K.
Moreover, we consider the following types of data for, re-
spectively, continuous and discrete variables:

the real line, i.e., xd

n ∈ {0, . . . ,∞}.

We remark that the main goal of this paper is to determine
the types of variables that better capture each attribute in
the observed matrix X, which in our method translates to
inferring the likelihood weights wd. However, solving this
inference problem in an efﬁcient way is a challenging task
for several reasons. First, we need to jointly infer all the la-
tent variables in the model, i.e., the low-rank representation

and the likelihood weights {wd}D
do so given a heterogeneous (and non-conjugate) observa-
tion model, which combines D different likelihood mod-
els, corresponding each of them to a mixture of likelihood
functions and coupled through the latent feature matrix Z.
Additionally, these likelihood functions do not only cor-
respond to either a probability density function or a prob-
ability mass function depending on whether we are deal-
ing with a continuous or a discrete variable, but also each
mixture combines likelihood functions with different sup-
ports. For example, while real-valued data lead to a like-
lihood function with the real line as support, interval data
only accounts for a segment of the real line. Similarly, both
categorical and ordinal data assume a ﬁnite support, while
count data requires an inﬁnite-support likelihood function.
In order to allow for efﬁcient inference, we exploit the key
idea in (Valera & Ghahramani, 2014) to propose an alter-
native and equivalent model representation (shown in Fig-
ure 1b), which efﬁciently deal with heterogeneous likeli-

1. Real-valued Data. In order to obtain real-valued ob-

other mapping functions can be used, e.g., we will use in
our experiments the transformation

x = f(cid:60)(y + u) = w(y + u) + µ,

where w and µ are parameters allowing attribute rescaling,
and tuneable by the user.
2. Positive Real-valued Data. As an example of a func-
tion that maps from the real numbers to the positive real
numbers, i.e., f(cid:60)+ : (cid:60) (cid:55)→ (cid:60)+, we consider

x = f(cid:60)+(y + u) = log(1 + exp(w(y + u))).

where w allows attribute rescaling.
3. Interval Data. As an example of a function the maps
from the real numbers into the interval (θL, θH ), i.e., f(cid:60)+ :
(cid:60) (cid:55)→ (θL, θH ), we consider the transformation

x = fInt(y + u) =

Scalability. The overall complexity of Algorithm 1 is
O(N DLmax + K 3) per iteration, where N is the number
of objects, D the number of attributes, Lmax the maximum
number of considered data types (or likelihood models) and
K the size of the low-rank representation. In all of our ex-
periments, we ran the MCMC for 5000 iterations, which
lasted 10-100 minutes depending on the dataset.
4. Evaluation
4.1. Experiments on synthetic data
In this section, we show that the proposed method is able
to accurately discover the true statistical type of variables
in synthetic datasets, where we have perfect knowledge of
the distribution from which the data have been generated.

First, we focus on continuous variables by generating uni-
variate datasets with 1, 000 observations sampled from a
known probability density function, which corresponds to
i) a Gaussian distribution when considering real-valued
data; ii) a Gamma distribution for positive real-valued data;
and iii) a (scaled) Beta distribution for interval data lying
in the interval (0, θL) where θL takes values 0.1, 1 or 100.
Figure 2 shows the distribution, by means of a boxplot,2 of
the inferred likelihood weights wd for 10 independent sim-
ulations of Algorithm 1 with 500 iterations on 10 indepen-
dent datasets generated with the parameters detailed in the
ﬁgure. Reassuringly we observe that the proposed method
identiﬁes interval data as the most likely type of data for the
three considered Beta distributions; moreover, as the tail of
the Beta distribution increases, so does the weight given to
the positive real-valued variables. This effect can be ex-
plained by the ﬁnite size of the dataset, since it is hard to
determine whether the variable is limited to values smaller
than θL, or we simply have not observed them in the ﬁnite
set of observations. A similar effect occurs when applying
our method to data sampled from Gamma (Figure 2(e)-(h))
and Gaussian (Figure 2(i)-(l)) distributions. Here, we ob-
serve that in addition to, respectively, positive real-valued
and real-valued data types, our model ﬁnds that the variable
may also be of interval data type. This effect is larger for
Gaussian variables, since in this example the Gaussian is a
more heavy-tailed distribution than the Gamma.

2In a boxplot, the central mark is the median, the edges of the
box are the 25th and 75th percentiles, the whiskers extend to the
10th and 90th percentiles.

Figure 3. [Synthetic Discrete Data] Distribution of the inferred
likelihood weights wd when the ground truth data is (a) categor-
ical, (b) ordinal, and (c) count data. For categorical and ordinal
data, we plot the likelihood weight distribution with respect to
both the number of categories in the data and the model complex-
ity K, and for count data with respect to K.

Next, we study whether the proposed model is able to dis-
ambiguate among different discrete types of variables, par-
ticularly, among categorical, ordinal and count data. To
this end, we generate three types of datasets of size 1, 000.
In the ﬁrst type we account for categorical data by sam-
pling a multinomial variable with R categories, where the
probability of the categories is sampled from a Dirichlet
distribution. Then, for each category we sample a multidi-
mensional Gaussian centroid that corresponds to the mean
of the multivariate Gaussian observations that complete the
dataset. To account for ordinal observations, we ﬁrst sam-
ple the ﬁrst variable in our dataset from a uniform distribu-
tion in the interval (0, R), which we randomly divide into
R categories that correspond to the ordinal variable in our
dataset. Finally, to account for count data we ﬁrst gener-
ate a Gamma variable sampled from Γ(α, α/4), and then
generate the counting variable in the dataset by taking the
ﬂoor of the Gamma variable. For both categorical and or-
dinal data, we generate 10 independent datasets for each
value of the number of categories R ∈ {3, . . . , 10}, and for
count data we generate another 10 datasets for each value
of α ∈ {2, . . . , 8}. Figure 3 summarizes the likelihood
weights obtained for each type of datasets (i.e., for each
type of discrete variable) after running on each dataset 10
independent simulations of Algorithm 1 with 500 iterations
for different model complexity values, i.e., for different
numbers of latent feature variables K = 1, . . . , 10. In this
ﬁgure we can observe that we can accurately discover the
true type of discrete variable robustly and independently
of the assumed model complexity K. We also observe on

the top row of Figure 3(a)-(b) that i) as the number of cat-
egories R in the discrete variable decreases, the harder is
to distinguish between ordinal and categorical data, i.e., to
ﬁnd out whether the data takes values in a ordered set or
in an unordered set; and ii) as R in ordinal data increases,
the ordinal variable is more likely to be identiﬁed as count
data. Both of these effects are intuitively sensible.
4.2. Experiments on real data
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the pro-
posed method on seven real datasets collected from the
UCI machine learning repository (Lichman, 2013). Table 1
summarizes theses datasets by providing the number of ob-
jects and attributes in the dataset, as well as how many of
these attributes are discrete.
In order to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the
proposed method, we select at random 10% of the observa-
tions in each dataset as a held-out set and compare the pre-
dictive performance, in terms of average test log-likelihood
per observation, of our method with a baseline method.
The baseline method corresponds to a latent feature model
in which all the continuous variables are modeled as real-
valued data and the discrete variables as categorical data.
Figure 4 shows the obtained results for our method (solid
line) and the baseline (dashed line) for several values of the
model complexity (i.e., the number of latent features K)
averaged over 10 independent runs of the corresponding
inference algorithms. Here, we observe that i) both meth-
ods provide robust results with respect to the number of
variables K; and ii) our method clearly outperforms the
baseline in all the datasets, except for the Student dataset
where the baseline performs slightly better. In other words,
this ﬁgure shows that by taking into account the uncertainty
in the statistical types of the variables, we provide a better
ﬁtting of the data.
Additionally, Table 2 shows the list of (non-binary) at-
tributes in the Adult and the German datasets together with
the data types with larger inferred likelihood weights,3 i.e.,
the discovered statistical data types. Here, the number in
parenthesis corresponds to the observed number of cate-
gories in discrete data. The very heterogeneous nature of
these datasets explains the substantial gain observed in Fig-
ure 4. Moreover, Table 2 shows some expected results, e.g.,

3In cases in which two data types present very similar likeli-

hood weights (< 10% difference), we display both of them.

marital status and race are identiﬁed as categorical, while
the age is of count data type for both datasets. However,
other results might seem surprising. For example, the du-
ration (in months), which one would expect it to be count
data, is identiﬁed as ordinal; or the a priori categorical at-
tributes native country and job are inferred to be ordinal.
In order to better understand these results, we show the his-
tograms of several variables in these datasets and the as-
sociated inferred likelihood weights. Figure 5 shows the
histograms of two continuous variables, length and weight
of the Abalone dataset, which take only positive real val-
ues, but are assigned to different data types (respectively, to
real-valued and positive real-valued data). This can be ex-
plained by the fact that, while the distribution of the length
presents large tails, the distribution of the weight is clearly
truncated at zero. Additionally, Figure 6(a)-(b) shows two
discrete variables, the duration (in months) and the age in
German data, which based on the documentation are ex-
pected to be count data. However, our model assigns the
duration to ordinal data. This result can be explained by the
irregular distribution that this variable has. In count data
the distance between every two consecutive values should
be roughly the same (there is the same distance from “1
pen” to “2 pens” as from “2 pens” to “3 pens”, that is 1
pen), resulting therefore in smooth probability mass func-
tions. We found in Figure 6(c)-(d) that while the number of
credits and the job variables can be a priori thought as re-

spectively count and categorical data, they are both inferred

this can be explained by the small (ﬁnite) number of values
that the variable takes, while in the case of the job, this as-
signment can be explained by the labels of its categories,
i.e., {unskilled non-resident, unskilled resident, skilled em-
ployee and highly qualiﬁed employee}, which clearly rep-
resent an ordered set.
From these results, we can conclude that i) our model accu-
rately discovers the true statistical type of the data, which
might not be easily extracted from its documentation; and
by doing so, ii) it provides a better ﬁt of the data. Moreover,
apparent failures are in fact sensible when data histograms
are carefully examined.
5. Conclusions
In this paper, we presented the ﬁrst approach to automat-
ically discover the statistical types of the variables in a
dataset. Our experiments showed that the proposed ap-
proach accurately infers the data type, or equivalently like-
lihood model, that best ﬁts the data.
Our work opens many interesting avenues for future work.
For example, it would be interesting to extend the pro-
posed method to account for other data types. We would
like to include directional data, also called circular data,
which arise in a multitude of data-modelling contexts rang-
ing from robotics to the social sciences (Navarro et al.,
2016). Moreover, since the proposed method can be seen
as a likelihood selection method, it would be interesting to
study how to incorporate our framework in any statistical
machine learning tool, where the likelihood model, instead
of being ﬁxed a priori, would be inferred directly from the
data jointly with the rest of the model parameters.
